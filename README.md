Developed with Unreal Engine 5

# Final push! Goodbye!
This is it, the testing video is done!
Admittedly, the project isn't finished, but I'm not working on it anymore.
In case anyone finds this and wants to know what the to-do list is:
Transfer between planets
    Hohmann
    Bi-elliptic
    Gravity slingshot

More spacecraft
The outer planets (Saturn, Neptune, Uranus, Pluto etc)
Gyroscopes
Part failure on the spacecraft
Eccentricity measurements
Elliptical orbits
More stars
Black hole support
Sending spacecraft out of the solar system
Faster timesteps
Takeoff from planets
Landing on planets
Spacecraft-to-spacecraft docking
Space stations
Chemical thrusters
Fix direction arrows for spacecraft
Inter-planet pathing for transfers
Custom planets
Presets for solar systems/spacecraft
Gridlines for orbit measurements

That's everything I can think of that was on my to-do list.
Good luck if you're interested, and thanks for reading!
Goodbye!
